# PHP Deprecated mysql_* Functions

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are insecure and have been removed from PHP 7.0 and later versions.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using the recommended `mysqli_*` functions or PDO.

**Problem:**
The original code uses outdated and insecure `mysql_*` functions for database interaction. This is risky due to SQL injection vulnerabilities and lack of support in newer PHP versions.

**Solution:**
The solution uses the `mysqli_*` functions which provide improved security and compatibility.  PDO (PHP Data Objects) is an even more flexible alternative and is preferred for complex database interactions.

Always update to the most current and secure database interaction techniques when working with PHP.
